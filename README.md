Here's an updated `README.md` file with your requested changes. I've added instructions about setting up the Docker container and also provided a placeholder for adding a video.

# Getting Started

First, you need to ensure Docker is set up to run the project locally.

### Step 1: Run Docker Container

Ensure Docker is installed and running on your machine. Then, run the following command in your terminal to start the Docker container for the project:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Once the Docker container is running, you can proceed to run the development server.

### Step 2: Start the Development Server

After setting up Docker, you can run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

## Demo Video

You can include a video demonstration of the project below:

This updated `README.md` now includes instructions to run Docker before starting the development server and provides space to embed a demo video later.
